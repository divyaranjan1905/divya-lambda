This is a personal Guix channel (pronounced "Divya Lambda") by me which aims to mostly fulfil the package requirements of the same, in those casese whence upstream packages are found to be unsatisfactory.

The packages here eventually plan to find themselves in the Guix repository upstream. My specific interests are in packaging Haskell, Rust packages and toolchain, libre audio software, among others.

* Channel Definition
You can add this channel to your configuration by adding the following to =~/.config/guix/channels.scm=:
